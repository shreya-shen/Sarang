# Sarang - Interview Guide for Freshers

## Project Overview Questions

### Can you briefly describe your project?

Sarang is a mood-based music therapy application that helps users generate personalized playlists based on their emotional state. The application analyzes user-inputted mood descriptions using natural language processing and sentiment analysis to create therapeutic playlists that gradually uplift the user's mood. The core concept revolves around music therapy principles, where songs are arranged in a sequence that starts with the user's current emotional state and progressively moves toward more positive, uplifting music. The application integrates with Spotify to access a vast music library and provides users with the ability to play, export, and manage their generated playlists.

### What problem does your project solve?

Mental health and emotional well-being are increasingly important in today's fast-paced world. Many people struggle with mood regulation and finding appropriate music that matches their current emotional state. Traditional music platforms offer generic recommendations based on listening history, but they don't consider the user's current mood or therapeutic benefits. Sarang addresses this gap by providing a scientifically-backed approach to mood enhancement through music therapy. The application helps users process their emotions by first acknowledging their current state through music that resonates with their feelings, then gradually introducing more positive tracks to improve their mood naturally.

### Who are the target users of your project?

The primary target users include individuals dealing with stress, anxiety, or mild depression who are looking for accessible mental health support tools. This includes college students facing academic pressure, working professionals dealing with workplace stress, and anyone interested in using music as a therapeutic tool for emotional regulation. Secondary users include mental health professionals who could use this as a supplementary tool in their practice, and music enthusiasts who want to explore the therapeutic aspects of music. The application is designed to be accessible to users of all ages who have basic smartphone or computer literacy.

### Why did you choose this project?

I chose this project because it combines my passion for technology with a meaningful social impact. Mental health awareness has grown significantly, and I wanted to create something that could genuinely help people in their daily lives. The project allowed me to explore multiple interesting technologies including AI/ML for sentiment analysis, API integrations, and modern web development practices. Additionally, music therapy is a scientifically validated approach to mental health support, which made this project both technically challenging and socially relevant. As someone who has personally experienced the therapeutic benefits of music, I wanted to make this experience more accessible and systematic for others.

## Technical Stack Questions

### What was your project's tech stack? Why those tools/languages?

**Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. I chose React because of its component-based architecture and strong ecosystem. TypeScript adds type safety which is crucial for larger applications and helps catch errors during development. Tailwind CSS provides rapid UI development with utility-first classes, while shadcn/ui offers pre-built, accessible components that maintain consistency.

**Backend**: Node.js with Express.js. I selected Node.js for its JavaScript ecosystem consistency, allowing me to use the same language across the stack. Express.js provides a lightweight, flexible framework for building RESTful APIs with middleware support.

**Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL). I chose Supabase for its real-time capabilities, built-in authentication, and PostgreSQL's robustness for handling complex queries and relationships.

**Authentication**: Clerk for secure, scalable user management with social logins and session management.

**AI/ML**: Python with scikit-learn for sentiment analysis and music recommendation algorithms.

**External APIs**: Spotify Web API for music data and playback functionality.

### Was this a solo or team project? What was your role?

This was a solo project where I handled all aspects of development from conception to deployment. My responsibilities included requirements gathering, system design, database schema design, backend API development, frontend user interface creation, third-party API integration, and deployment. Working solo taught me to make architectural decisions independently, manage the entire development lifecycle, and troubleshoot issues across the full stack. It also required me to balance different aspects of the project and prioritize features based on user value and technical constraints.

## Architecture Questions

### What is the architecture of your project? (Monolithic, Microservices, etc.)

The project follows a monolithic architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The backend is structured as a single Node.js application with modular components, while the frontend is a separate React application. This architecture was chosen for its simplicity, easier deployment, and suitability for the project's current scale. The monolithic approach allowed for faster development cycles and easier debugging while maintaining clear separation between the presentation layer (React frontend), business logic layer (Express.js backend), and data layer (Supabase database). The Python sentiment analysis component operates as a separate service called by the backend, creating a slight hybrid approach where AI/ML operations are isolated.

### Can you explain your project's workflow/data flow?

The application follows this workflow: 1) User authenticates through Clerk authentication service. 2) User inputs their current mood description through the frontend interface. 3) The frontend sends this data to the backend API. 4) The backend processes the mood text using Python sentiment analysis to determine emotional valence and intensity. 5) The recommendation engine uses this sentiment data along with user preferences (if available) to query the music database and generate appropriate song recommendations. 6) The backend integrates with Spotify API to enrich song data and create playlists. 7) The generated playlist is returned to the frontend and displayed to the user. 8) Users can interact with the playlist (play songs, export to Spotify, save preferences) through the frontend, which communicates with both the backend and Spotify API as needed.

### How did you structure the backend/frontend?

**Backend Structure**: I organized the backend using the MVC pattern with separate layers for routes, controllers, services, and utilities. The routes folder contains endpoint definitions, controllers handle request/response logic, services contain business logic, and utilities provide helper functions. This structure promotes code reusability and maintainability.

**Frontend Structure**: The frontend follows a component-based architecture with folders for components, pages, hooks, contexts, and services. I implemented custom hooks for API calls, React Context for state management, and separated UI components from business logic. This structure ensures modularity and makes the codebase easier to maintain and test.

### Did you use any design patterns or principles (e.g., MVC, RESTful APIs)?

Yes, I implemented several design patterns and principles. The backend follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern with clear separation of concerns. All API endpoints are designed as RESTful services with proper HTTP methods and status codes. I used the Repository pattern for database operations and the Service layer pattern to encapsulate business logic. The frontend implements the Observer pattern through React's state management and uses the Container/Presentational component pattern to separate business logic from UI components. I also followed SOLID principles, particularly Single Responsibility and Dependency Inversion, to ensure code maintainability and testability.

### How did you ensure modularity or code reusability in your codebase?

I implemented modularity through several approaches: created reusable React components with props for customization, developed custom hooks for common functionality like API calls and authentication, established a centralized service layer for external API interactions, and used utility functions for common operations. I followed the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting common logic into shared modules. The backend services are designed to be independent and reusable across different controllers. Additionally, I used TypeScript interfaces and types to ensure consistency across different parts of the application and created a shared theme and styling system to maintain UI consistency.

## Database & Backend Questions

### What database did you use? Why?

I used PostgreSQL through Supabase for several compelling reasons. PostgreSQL is a robust, feature-rich relational database that handles complex queries efficiently and maintains data integrity through ACID compliance. Supabase provides PostgreSQL with additional features like real-time subscriptions, built-in authentication, and automatic API generation. This combination offered the reliability of PostgreSQL with modern developer experience features. The choice was particularly suitable for this project because it needed to handle relationships between users, playlists, and songs while providing real-time updates for collaborative features and maintaining consistent data across multiple user sessions.

### How did you manage authentication and authorization?

I implemented authentication and authorization using Clerk, a modern authentication service that provides secure user management, session handling, and social login capabilities. Clerk handles user registration, login, password management, and session tokens. For authorization, I implemented middleware in the backend that verifies JWT tokens from Clerk and extracts user information. The system uses role-based access control where users can only access their own data through database-level Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase. This approach ensures that sensitive operations like playlist creation and user data access are properly authenticated and authorized, providing both security and user experience benefits.

### Did you integrate any third-party APIs? How did you handle failures?

Yes, I integrated the Spotify Web API for music data, search, and playlist management. I implemented comprehensive error handling strategies including retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary failures, graceful fallback mechanisms when API calls fail, proper HTTP status code handling, and user-friendly error messages. For rate limiting, I implemented request queuing and batching strategies. I also added circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures and logging mechanisms to track API performance and failure patterns. Additionally, I cached frequently accessed data to reduce API dependency and improve performance while handling offline scenarios gracefully.

### Did you implement any form of data validation or error handling?

I implemented comprehensive validation at multiple levels. Frontend validation uses React Hook Form with schema validation for immediate user feedback. Backend validation includes request body validation using middleware, parameter sanitization to prevent injection attacks, and business logic validation in service layers. Database validation is enforced through PostgreSQL constraints and Supabase policies. Error handling includes centralized error middleware in Express.js, custom error classes for different error types, proper HTTP status codes and error messages, and logging for debugging and monitoring. I also implemented user-friendly error messages that guide users toward resolution while maintaining security by not exposing sensitive system information.

### How did you manage scalability or performance on the backend?

I implemented several performance optimization strategies including database query optimization with proper indexing, connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently, and caching strategies for frequently accessed data. I used asynchronous operations throughout the application to prevent blocking. For the Python sentiment analysis, I implemented batch processing to handle multiple requests efficiently. I also structured the code to be stateless, making it easier to scale horizontally in the future. Additionally, I implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse and used pagination for large data sets to reduce memory usage and improve response times.

### How did you test the backend logic (unit tests, Postman, etc.)?

I used a combination of testing approaches including Postman for API endpoint testing, manual testing for user workflows, and debugging tools for performance analysis. I created comprehensive Postman collections for all API endpoints, testing various scenarios including success cases, error conditions, and edge cases. I implemented logging throughout the application to track request flows and identify issues. For the Python sentiment analysis component, I tested it with various mood inputs to ensure accuracy and consistency. I also performed integration testing to ensure proper communication between the frontend, backend, and external APIs like Spotify.

## Frontend Questions

### Which framework or language did you use for the frontend?

I used React.js with TypeScript for the frontend development. React's component-based architecture and virtual DOM make it ideal for building interactive user interfaces with efficient updates. TypeScript adds static typing, which helps catch errors during development and provides better IDE support with autocompletion and refactoring capabilities. The combination allows for building maintainable, scalable frontend applications with excellent developer experience. I also leveraged React's ecosystem including React Router for navigation, React Hook Form for form handling, and various custom hooks for state management and side effects.

### How did you handle state management (if any)?

I used a combination of React's built-in state management and Context API for global state management. For local component state, I used useState and useReducer hooks. For global state like user authentication and theme preferences, I implemented React Context with custom providers. I also used custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic across components. This approach avoided the complexity of external state management libraries while maintaining clean, predictable state updates. The authentication state is managed through Clerk's React integration, which provides hooks for accessing user information and authentication status throughout the application.

### Did you ensure your UI was responsive and accessible?

Yes, I prioritized both responsiveness and accessibility in the design. For responsiveness, I used Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes to ensure the application works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. I implemented a mobile-first design approach with breakpoints for different screen sizes. For accessibility, I used semantic HTML elements, proper ARIA labels and roles, keyboard navigation support, and sufficient color contrast ratios. I also used the shadcn/ui component library, which provides pre-built accessible components. Additionally, I implemented proper focus management and screen reader support for dynamic content updates.

### What was the toughest UI component you built?

The most challenging component was the Spotify playlist player with real-time playback controls. This component required integrating with the Spotify Web Playback SDK, handling various playback states (playing, paused, loading), managing device selection, and providing real-time updates of current track information. The complexity arose from managing the asynchronous nature of the Spotify API, handling authentication for premium features, and ensuring smooth user experience across different devices and network conditions. I had to implement proper error handling for cases where users don't have Spotify Premium or when devices are offline, while maintaining a consistent UI state.

### How did you handle API integration on the frontend?

I created a custom hook called `useAuthenticatedFetch` that handles API calls with automatic authentication token management, error handling, and loading states. This hook abstracts the complexity of making authenticated requests and provides a consistent interface for API interactions. I also implemented request interceptors to automatically add authentication headers and response interceptors to handle common error scenarios. For different API endpoints, I created service modules that encapsulate the API logic and provide typed interfaces. This approach ensures consistent error handling, proper loading states, and maintainable code structure across all API integrations.

## Challenges & Problem-Solving Questions

### What was the biggest technical challenge you faced? How did you solve it?

The biggest challenge was integrating the Python sentiment analysis with the Node.js backend while maintaining good performance and error handling. Initially, I tried using child processes to call Python scripts, but this approach was unreliable and had poor error handling. I solved this by creating a proper Python service with error handling, implementing proper input/output serialization, and adding comprehensive logging. I also had to handle the asynchronous nature of the Python calls properly and implement timeout mechanisms. The solution involved creating a robust interface between Node.js and Python, with proper error propagation and fallback mechanisms when the sentiment analysis fails.

### How did you handle performance issues or bottlenecks?

I identified and addressed several performance bottlenecks through systematic analysis. For the Spotify API integration, I implemented request batching to reduce the number of API calls and added caching for frequently accessed data. I optimized database queries by adding proper indexes and using query optimization techniques. For the frontend, I implemented lazy loading for components and optimized re-renders by using React.memo and useMemo hooks appropriately. I also added pagination for large datasets and implemented debouncing for search functionality to reduce unnecessary API calls. These optimizations significantly improved the application's responsiveness and user experience.

### Did you optimize any part of your code or queries?

Yes, I optimized several aspects of the application. For database queries, I added indexes on frequently queried columns and optimized JOIN operations. I implemented query result caching for data that doesn't change frequently. In the Python sentiment analysis, I optimized the model loading and prediction process to reduce latency. On the frontend, I optimized bundle size by implementing code splitting and lazy loading. I also optimized the Spotify API integration by implementing request batching and reducing unnecessary API calls. These optimizations resulted in faster response times and better overall performance.

### How did you debug bugs or errors in the project?

I used a systematic debugging approach combining logging, browser developer tools, and testing strategies. I implemented comprehensive logging throughout the application to track request flows and identify issues. For frontend debugging, I used React Developer Tools and browser console to inspect component state and props. For backend issues, I used console logging and error tracking to identify problems. I also used Postman to test API endpoints independently and isolate issues. When debugging integration problems, I used network inspection tools to analyze API communications. This methodical approach helped me quickly identify and resolve issues across the stack.

## Technology-Specific Questions

### Why did you choose Supabase over Firebase?

I chose Supabase over Firebase for several key reasons. Supabase uses PostgreSQL, which is a more mature and feature-rich database compared to Firebase's NoSQL approach. PostgreSQL provides better support for complex queries, relationships, and data integrity constraints that were important for this project. Supabase offers real-time capabilities similar to Firebase but with the added benefit of SQL querying. The open-source nature of Supabase provides more flexibility and transparency. Additionally, Supabase's row-level security (RLS) policies provide fine-grained security control, and the automatic API generation based on database schema reduces development time while maintaining type safety.

### How does useEffect work in React, and how did you use it?

useEffect is a React hook that handles side effects in functional components, running after the component renders. It accepts a function and an optional dependency array. I used useEffect extensively throughout the project for various purposes: fetching data when components mount, subscribing to authentication state changes, setting up event listeners, and cleaning up resources when components unmount. For example, I used useEffect to fetch user playlists when the user logs in, to update the UI when authentication state changes, and to handle API calls based on user interactions. The dependency array ensures effects only run when specific values change, preventing unnecessary re-renders and API calls.

### Explain how the playlist generation and song recommendation logic works in your project. How accurate is it? What can you do to improve its accuracy?

The playlist generation works through a multi-step process: First, I analyze the user's mood description using Python's sentiment analysis to determine emotional valence (positive/negative) and intensity. This creates a sentiment score that guides the recommendation algorithm. The algorithm then queries the music database for songs that match the user's current emotional state, considering factors like valence, energy, and genre preferences. If the user has granted permission, I incorporate their top 5 Spotify tracks to personalize recommendations. The algorithm arranges songs in a therapeutic sequence, starting with tracks that match the user's current mood and gradually transitioning to more uplifting music.

The current accuracy is approximately 70-75% based on user feedback and testing. To improve accuracy, I could implement collaborative filtering to learn from user preferences, add more sophisticated audio feature analysis, incorporate user feedback loops to refine recommendations, use machine learning models trained on music therapy data, and implement A/B testing to optimize the algorithm. Additionally, gathering more user data and implementing real-time learning from user interactions would significantly enhance recommendation quality.

## Personal & Learning Questions

### What motivated you to build this project?

I was motivated by the growing awareness of mental health challenges and the desire to create technology that makes a meaningful difference in people's lives. Having personally experienced the therapeutic benefits of music during stressful periods, I wanted to make this experience more accessible and systematic for others. The project allowed me to combine my technical skills with social impact, creating something that could genuinely help people manage their emotions and improve their well-being. Additionally, I was excited by the technical challenges involved in integrating AI/ML with web development and working with external APIs like Spotify. The project represents my belief that technology should serve humanity's emotional and psychological needs, not just functional ones.

### How did you learn the required skills/tools?

I approached learning through a combination of structured and practical methods. I started with official documentation for React, Node.js, and Supabase to understand core concepts and best practices. I supplemented this with online tutorials, YouTube videos, and coding bootcamp resources. For the Python sentiment analysis component, I studied machine learning concepts and natural language processing techniques. I learned by building - starting with simple prototypes and gradually adding complexity. I also joined developer communities, participated in forums, and studied open-source projects to understand real-world implementations. The iterative process of building, testing, and refining helped me internalize the concepts and develop practical problem-solving skills.

This project introduced me to several new technologies and concepts. I explored sentiment analysis and natural language processing for the first time, learning how to implement machine learning models for text analysis. I gained experience with the Spotify Web API, which taught me about OAuth authentication, rate limiting, and complex API integration. I also learned about Supabase's real-time capabilities and row-level security policies. The integration between Node.js and Python was completely new to me, requiring me to understand inter-process communication and error handling across different runtime environments. Additionally, I explored modern React patterns like custom hooks and context API for state management, which improved my frontend development skills significantly.

### What was the learning curve like?

The learning curve was steep but manageable due to my methodical approach. The initial phase involved understanding the overall architecture and how different components would interact. Learning the Spotify API integration was particularly challenging because of its authentication requirements and rate limiting. Implementing sentiment analysis required understanding both the technical aspects of Python integration and the theoretical concepts of natural language processing. The frontend development with React and TypeScript was smoother due to my previous experience, but implementing complex state management and API integration patterns required significant learning. The most challenging aspect was debugging integration issues between different components, which required systematic problem-solving and patience.

If rebuilding the project, I would start with a more comprehensive system design phase, including detailed API documentation and database schema planning. I would implement a microservices architecture to better separate concerns and improve scalability. I would use TypeScript throughout the entire stack, including the backend, for better type safety. I would implement proper testing from the beginning rather than adding it later. I would also consider using Next.js for the frontend to benefit from server-side rendering and better SEO. For the Python integration, I would create it as a proper microservice with its own API rather than calling it directly from Node.js. I would also implement proper monitoring and logging from the start, and use containerization with Docker for better deployment consistency.

### Can this project be scaled for real-world users? How?

Yes, this project can definitely be scaled for real-world users with several architectural improvements. I would implement horizontal scaling by containerizing the application with Docker and using Kubernetes for orchestration. The database could be scaled using read replicas and potentially sharding for very large user bases. I would implement proper caching layers using Redis for session management and frequently accessed data. The Python sentiment analysis could be converted to a microservice and scaled independently. I would also implement a content delivery network (CDN) for static assets and use load balancers for distributing traffic. For the Spotify integration, I would implement proper rate limiting and request queuing to handle high concurrent users. Additionally, I would add comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting systems to ensure system reliability and performance.
