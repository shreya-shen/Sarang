    checkSpotifyPermission();
  }
}, [user]); // Runs when user changes
```

**Cleanup Operations:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(updatePlaybackState, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval); // Cleanup
}, []);
```

**Event Listeners:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

**Conditional Effects:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isPlaying && currentTrack) {
    startProgressTracking();
  }
}, [isPlaying, currentTrack]);
```

### Explain how the playlist generation and song recommendation logic works in your project. How accurate is it?
